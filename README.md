# 3D-Scene-

## Design Approach
- Followed a **modular design** with separate classes for Camera, Shader, and Renderer.  
- Implemented **user-friendly controls** for smooth camera panning, zooming, and orbiting.  
- Applied **performance optimizations**, reducing redundant calculations and improving efficiency.  

## Development Process  
- Used an **iterative approach**, starting with basic functionality and refining controls.  
- Debugged transformations using matrix logging and real-time testing.  
- Experimented with shader programming for improved lighting and rendering effects.  

## Key Learnings & Applications 
- Strengthened knowledge of 3D transformations, lighting, and shading techniques.  
- Gained experience with real-time rendering and performance optimizations.  
- Applicable skills for game development, UI/UX, and data visualization.  

This project enhanced my ability to develop structured, efficient, and interactive 3D applications.
